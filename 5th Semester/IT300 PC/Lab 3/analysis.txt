Analysis:

nth Fibonacci number:
- Using task to seperate logical units of the function for parallelism is a bad idea, because the threads generated may not join, causing the value returned to not be correct.
- Hence, taskwait is used. Though it carries a greater overhead, it ensures that the threads are joined, ensuring correctness of the program.
- Also, for values less than 20, the function falls back to using the serialised version, as the overheads generated by the parallelised version outweighs the gains, taking more time. 

Quicksort:
- Using taskwait in combination with task and shared memory, though adds overhead, allows the program to be parallelised correctly..
- The time gained by parallelising the program is more obvious for larger values of the size of the array.
