# Requirements

For the E-Commerce website, the most essential piece of information is the products that are going to be sold, and the sellers of those products. Additional useful information would be the kind of users that the website is targeted to.

# Modules

* Home Page (Highlights)
* Browse Products using Filters
* Shopping Cart
* User Authentication
* Feedback

## Module-wise explanation

### Home Page
The home page is the first page that the user sees when they open the website for the first time.

To look attractive and engaging, it is essential to highlight any deals or discounts going on in products. Amazon does this very well.

### User Authentication
Basic Sign In, Sign Up, Sign Out for any user. Additionally, there should be a profile for each user, showing his/her purchases, and links to cars.

### Browse Products
Just like how knowing what products are sold is essential to the company, a user being able to search for products that cater to his liking is just as important. Thus, a filter-based search, or even a list of products is important.

### Shopping Cart
To purchase products in a supermarket, we employ the use of a basket or shopping cart. Similarly, users should be able to put items they intend to purchase in a virtual 'shopping cart' so that they can checkout later.

### Feedback
Although not really neccessary, in the age of the Internet, where the customer has triumphed King, he/she should be able to provide positive feedback, suggestions, or constructive criticism. An e-mail listed publicly helps, but even better would be a form for the same, so that he/she doesn't need to leave the site.

# Strategy

* Get a list of products to be sold, and sellers for each

* Conduct a class-wide survey regarding what students want to see in an e-commerce platform.

* Using those inputs, design a basic homepage and product listing.

* After a review from classmates, go ahead with shopping cart and feedback

* Continue to design and implement newer modules such as payments and recommendations
